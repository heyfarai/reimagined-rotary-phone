## ABOUT THE WORKSHOP
UX Launchpad is co-founded by Jon Bell and William Van Hecke, two experienced designers who love to teach. Jon is a designer at Twitter and William is a designer at Facebook.

Come learn how to run a different kind of brainstorm, and use it to ship the kinds of products you can be proud of. Studies of the brain show we learn better when we're happy and surprised, so this workshop will be informative, fun, and surprising.

## ABOUT WILLIAM
William has shipped over 20 major releases of the Omni Group’s unusually powerful productivity apps — OmniFocus, OmniGraffle, OmniOutliner, and OmniPlan — spanning Mac, iOS, and Apple Watch. These apps have won Apple Design Awards and have been featured by App Store editors countless times. Constantly zooming in to the finest details and out to the grandest concerns are a regular part of the job. William’s approach focuses on flexibility, durability, and respect for users. With Jon Bell, William runs UX Launchpad, a company that teaches design.
