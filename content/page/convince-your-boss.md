## HERE'S AN EXAMPLE LETTER FOR YOUR BOSS
**Dear** [insert boss name/title]

PIXEL UP!, a conference for people like me who work on digital products, is happening 12 to 14 September 2016 in Johannesburg. It gathers some of the brightest names from around the globe to give talks and workshops. It will be an opportunity for me to hear stories and get face-to-face advice from design leaders from companies like Dropbox and Twitter, as well as scrappy upstarts who are clawing their way to success one customer at a time.

I truly feel that attending PIXEL UP! will help me to grow not only personally but also as an integral part of [insert company name].

As you know, continuing education is an important part of any employee's career and there's nowhere else that I will have access to so many levels of information in one place without going overseas.

More specifically, I wanted to point out the benefits that both I and [company name] will receive by attending the event:

- **I will increase my productivity** — While I will certainly be attending PIXEL UP! in order to learn, a relaxed atmosphere, away from the office, will energize me and allow me to work better when I return.
- **I will return inspired** — PIXEL UP! specifically chooses speakers that talk not only about how they succeeded, but also how they failed and what they learned from it.
- **I will be better at my job** — One of the many points offered by PIXEL UP! is insight from design leaders about the things they found that made them better in business. These points can help me to find areas in which I can improve.
- **I will learn more about our UX & UI design** — My employment with [company name] is not just a job to me. I joined [company name] as a career decision and what I learn at PIXEL UP! can only serve to bolster my knowledge and thirst for success.
As I'm sure you can see, attending PIXEL UP! will not only benefit me personally and professionally, but there is a fantastic opportunity for our business to grow as a result of what I experience. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to read these points, and I thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, *[your name]*.

                            <h4>4 Tips on Having the conversation with your boss</h4>
                            <ul class="no-bullet">
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Pick the right time to talk about it</h6>
                                    <p>Ask the married folks, for a proposal, timing could mean the difference between #epicwin and #epicfail. To make sure you have your boss’ full attention, plan to speak to them during a time of day that has the least stress for both of you. For example, planning this conversation after a day of back-to-back meetings — not a good idea. Likewise, you know what you’re like when you haven’t had your lunch yet. Don’t try to get an approval from a ’hangry’ boss. Think about cigarette breaks and coffee breaks etc. You know your boss’s rhythms and moods, use this to your advantage.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Have a strong, simple proposal</h6>
                                    <p>This will not only help you keep your thoughts organised, but might just impress your boss too. It’ll show you’re serious enough about this opportunity to do your homework. Also, no waffling and beating around the bush: cut to the chase and make it relevant to the questions you anticipate from your boss.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Play dirty</h6>
                                    <p>Know about your bosses shady deals? The got a little thing on the side? That always helps.
                                    Just kidding. Sort of.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Show enthusiasm</h6>
                                    <p>People respond well to positive energy, it can be contagious. Go into the meeting with confidence and enthusiasm, your boss might be more inclined to see your side and give you what you’re asking for. Even if you feel nervous, fake it ’til you make it and you’ll come across in a positive light.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Most importantly, listen to your gut. Every boss is different, and you know your boss better than we do. For the most part, however, if you follow these guidelines, you’ll make it much easier for your boss to give you the green light.</p>
                            <p>If all else fails, email us at <a href="mailto:boss-support@pixelup.co.za?subject=Help, my boss doesn't get it">boss-support@pixelup.co.za</a>, but this is the nuclear option, only use it as a last resort.</p>
