## ABOUT WARWICK
In his 16 years within the banking industry, Warwick has remained on the cusp of new technologies – applying his expertise at the nexus of Business and IT.

Warwick believes that anything is possible by applying creativity and persistence. Dealing with arthritis from an early age, and having to find new and creative ways to live a full life, he now revels in ascending as high on the earth’s 7 mountain summits as physical constraints allow.

It’s this philosophy that enables him to infuse creativity, determination and powerful collaboration into his teams – to surmount seemingly-impossible business challenges.

Warwick is passionate about sustainability at a broader level, particularly in bettering lives through sustainable water and power solutions in communities within the developing world.

He holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Wits, and MBA from GIBS.
