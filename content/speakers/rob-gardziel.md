## PROVING THE BUSINESS VALUE OF DESIGN
A new awareness of the importance of design has lead to a new trend, with companies snapping up designers as fast as they can. However, hiring a group of designers won’t make a user-centric company culture overnight. This talk will cover how to integrate design into your company so that it has a meaningful impact on company strategy and the bottom line. I’ll focus on identifying opportunities and tackling them, with baselines, KPIs, testing, and communicating with executives.
