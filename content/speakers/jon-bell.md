## LAST TALK OF THE DAY BUT IT'LL BE GREAT I PROMISE
Jon Bell will be blending his most popular talks and essays into a Greatest Hits collection that touches on everything he's learned about product design and being the kind of person people love to work with.

## UX LAUNCHPAD - DESIGN PLAY
UX Launchpad is co-founded by Jon Bell and William Van Hecke, two experienced designers who love to teach. Jon is a designer at Twitter and William is a designer at Facebook.

Come learn how to run a different kind of brainstorm, and use it to ship the kinds of products you can be proud of. Studies of the brain show we learn better when we're happy and surprised, so this workshop will be informative, fun, and surprising.
